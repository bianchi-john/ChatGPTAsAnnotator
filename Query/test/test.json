"content": "Use the following step-by-step instructions to respond to user inputs.\nStep 1 - The user will provide you with a text of a newspaper article. \nStep 2 -  Given the following questions (delimited by triple quotes), answer them to assess the quality of the journal article.''' \nQ1.1: \n    Question: \n        What type of news article are you reviewing? (Check one).\n    Instructions: \n        Please evaluate this question based on the tone and structure of the plain text\n        article. For example, straight news pieces are typically brief, to the point, use a\n        factual tone, and employ the inverted pyramid structure. Feature pieces tend to be\n        longer and more in-depth. Lifestyle content typically employs a light tone and is\n        structured in the form of a list, a photo gallery, a series of tweets, etc. Opinion\n        articles are intended to persuade and often use the first person.\n        Content covering celebrities, sports, travel, or current events should be evaluated\n        based on its structure and tone. For example, a fact-based article written in a\n        straight new style covering a sporting event can be considered straight news, while\n        an in-depth article on the politics behind a popular travel destination can be\n        considered a feature. Conversely, a collection of tweets from professional athletes\n        or a list of the ten best vacations for families with kids should be considered lifestyle\n        content.\n        Select “Straight news, or 'hard news'” if the article reports only the most essential\n        information in a concise and impartial manner. Straight news stories typically follow\n        the inverted pyramid style, which organises information by descending order of\n        importance or places the most newsworthy information at the beginning of the\n        article.\n        Select “Editorial/opinion” if the article communicates the author’s personal point of\n        view about current events and topics, in order to develop an argument about an\n        issue and potentially sway readers’ opinions. Opinion pieces include editorials,\n        op-eds, commentary, analysis and letters to the editor.\n        Select “Feature/investigation” if the article is more in-depth than a traditional\n        straight news article. Feature pieces tend to be longer, to provide more background\n        on a person, event or issue and usually have a more “storytelling” tone, compared\n        to straight new pieces. When writing features, writers typically have more flexibility\n        to use a wider range of formats, provide rich descriptions, and include scene-setting anecdotes. Investigative stories and interviews are considered\n        features.\n        Select “Lifestyle content, obituary, 'listicle' or other 'soft news'” if the article departs\n        from the tone or structure of other news content (straight news, feature pieces and\n        opinion pieces), such as presenting information in a list or relying heavily on social\n        media. These articles typically cover fashion, pet care, horoscope readings, recipes,\n        etc. Obituaries should be included in this category.\n        Select “Satire” if the article uses hyperbole or exaggeration as a literary device to\n        tell a story. Satire articles generally have some level of truth which has been blown\n        out of proportion. Satire articles often make use of comic devices that can include\n        paradoxes, or clearly contradictory statements; highly sarcastic and biting remarks;\n        puns or wordplay; and even slapstick scenarios.\n    Variable values:\n        1.  Straight news, or 'hard news'\n        2.  Editorial/opinion\n        3.  Feature/investigation\n        4.  Satire\n        5.
